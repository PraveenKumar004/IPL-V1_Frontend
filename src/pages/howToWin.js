                                            To start, you need to bid for and acquire a team of 11 players. Your team must adhere to the following composition rules:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Minimum 1 Wicketkeeper (WK)</strong>: Essential for managing catches, stumps, and batting prowess.</li>
                                                <li><strong>2 Batsmen</strong>: Provide stability and scoring power at the top and middle order.</li>
                                                <li><strong>2 Bowlers</strong>: Ensure your team has the firepower to dismiss opposition batsmen.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Minimum 5 Players Who Can Bowl</strong>: This includes bowlers and all-rounders, providing your team with necessary bowling options. <strong>For Example: </strong>2 bowlers + 3 all-rounders.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Maximum 4 Foreign Players</strong>: Ensure that your team composition aligns with IPL regulations regarding overseas players.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                        <h4>Understand the Pointing System</h4>
                                    </Card.Header>

                                            Each player's performance in the IPL matches contributes to their points, which are then added to your team's total. Here's how the pointing system works:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Individual Player Points:</strong> Each player earns points based on their match performance (runs, wickets, catches, and stumpings).</li>
                                                <li><strong>Captain's Points:</strong> The points scored by your Captain are multiplied by 2.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Vice-Captain's Points:</strong> The points scored by your Vice-Captain are multiplied by 1.5.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Total Team Points:</strong> The total points of all 11 players, including the multiplied points of the Captain and Vice-Captain, determine your teamâ€™s score.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            By understanding and leveraging this point system, you can maximize your team's total score and enhance your chances of winning.

The points system considers contributions such as runs scored, wickets taken, catches, and stumpings. Calculate your team's potential points and strategize accordingly to maximize your score.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Choose Captain and Vice-Captain Wisely:</strong> Select one player as the Captain and another as the Vice-Captain from your team. The points earned by the Captain are multiplied by 2, while the Vice-Captain's points are multiplied by 1.5. These boosted points are added to your team's overall score. Choose players who are consistent performers for these crucial roles.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Compete and Aim for the Top:</strong> Compete against other contestants in IPL matches and aim to accumulate the highest total points. The contestant with the highest cumulative points at the end of the season stands a chance to be chosen as the winner by the manager. Keep track of your progress and adjust your strategies to stay ahead.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Engage with the Community:</strong> Join discussions with other contestants, share tips, and learn from each other's strategies. Engaging with the community can provide insights and help refine your gameplay. Collaboration and interaction can often lead to new strategies and ideas to improve your team's performance.</li>
                                            </ul>
