                                            To start, you need to bid for and acquire a team of 11 players. Your team must adhere to the following composition rules:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Minimum 1 Wicketkeeper (WK)</strong>: Essential for managing catches, stumps, and batting prowess.</li>
                                                <li><strong>2 Batsmen</strong>: Provide stability and scoring power at the top and middle order.</li>
                                                <li><strong>2 Bowlers</strong>: Ensure your team has the firepower to dismiss opposition batsmen.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Minimum 5 Players Who Can Bowl</strong>: This includes bowlers and all-rounders, providing your team with necessary bowling options. <strong>For Example : </strong> 2 bowlers + 3 all-rounders </li>
                                                <li><strong>Maximum 4 Foreign Players</strong>: Ensure that your team composition aligns with IPL regulations regarding overseas players.</li>
